=================

This is my personal webpage. It's pretty simple (and could use a bit of love here and there), but it gets the job done. 

I took a fair bit of inspiration from Google's "Material Design" [guideline](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html), which I find really great.

In case you are wondering, the font used is
[Blackout](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Blackout) and the color pallette can be found [here](http://www.paletton.com/#uid=55u1+0kw0upp5qqtitbCwvwJmxo).

The HTML version of my resume is served by [RawGit](https://rawgit.com/), which is a rather handy service. 

#### Future plans:

Responsiveness!

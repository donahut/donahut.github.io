=================

This is my personal webpage. It's pretty simple (and could use a bit of love here and there), but it gets the job done. 

Perusing through Google's Material Design [guidelines](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) is what initially inspired this design, expecially the colors and "cards".

In case you are wondering, the title font used is
[Bebas](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/bebas) and the color pallette can be found [here](http://www.paletton.com/#uid=55u1+0kw0upp5qqtitbCwvwJmxo).

The HTML version of my resume is served by [RawGit](https://rawgit.com/), which is a rather handy service. 

#### Future plans:

1. Better mobile
2. Project listing
